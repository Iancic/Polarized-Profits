You have 60 seconds to bring as many coins as you can in the piggy bank. The piggy bank will move randomly across the screen, so you will need to use the magnet to capture and direct the falling coins into the piggy bank. But watch out, the thief hands are coming to steal your coins! Repel them by changing the polarity of your magnet, but do so carefully, because you will also repel the coins in the process! After the 60 seconds are over, it is time to transfer as many captured coins as you can from the piggy bank into your wallet. The coins will fall from the top of the screen and you will need to move your wallet left and right to catch them. Whatever you can catch in your wallet are your polarized profits! Good luck!

How To Play:
W, A, S, D - Move The Magnet / Wallet
Spacebar - Change Polarity (Red Attracts Coins, Blue Repels Coins & Hands)

Rules: 
You have 60 seconds to collect the coins into the piggy bank.
Avoid getting to close to the magnet. You can break your coins if not careful.
Repel the thief's hands using the blue magnet to prevent it from stealing your coins.
Confirm your profits using the wallet.
